# HIDING TEXT IN A IMAGE 


To send private information discreetly, employ end-to-end encryption, VPNs, and secure messaging apps like Signal. Steganography hides data within innocuous files, and one-time pads offer highly secure key-based communication. Leveraging anonymous networks such as Tor enhances anonymity, while avoiding obvious keywords minimizes detection risk. Physical transfer and secure file transfer protocols provide additional layers of security. Always adapt strategies based on the specific context for optimal privacy.
